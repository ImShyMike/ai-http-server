Isn't HTTP just text?

---

## WHat is this?

An HTTP server implemented using a raw [asyncio](https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio.html) socket in which all content, including the HTTP headers, are fully AI generated.

Caching functionality is also in place to avoid excessive AI api calls.

## Why?

~~Why not?~~ AI is now taking over the entire world so why not let it run the web as well!

## Why does it look so bad?

Idk, ask the AI model ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯

## Usage

Simply run the `server.py` file using Python and connect to the server running on `localhost:8000`.
